# Ignore catalog subsystem failures during startup (default is to continue, so errors can be viewed via the API)

# Ignore persistence/HA subsystem failures during startup (default is to continue, so errors can be viewed via the API)

# The high availability mode. Possible values are:
# - AUTO: (default) will look for other management nodes, and will allocate itself as standby or master based on other nodes' states,
#   using HOT_STANDBY as the preferred standby unless the `defaultStandbyIsHot` experimental feature is set false;
# - MASTER: will startup as master - if there is already a master then fails immediately;
# - DISABLED: management node works in isolation - will not cooperate with any other standby/master nodes in management plane,
#   will assume no other nodes are using the same persisted state, and may break persistence if other nodes are;
# - STANDBY: will start up as lukewarm standby with no state - if there is not already a master then fails immediately,
#   and if there is a master which subsequently fails, this node can promote itself;
# - HOT_STANDBY: will start up as hot standby in read-only mode - if there is not already a master then fails immediately,
#   and if there is a master which subsequently fails, this node can promote itself;
# - HOT_BACKUP: will start up as hot backup in read-only mode - no master is required, and this node will not become a master
#highAvailabilityMode=AUTO

# The persistence mode. Possible values are:
# - AUTO: (default) will rebind to any existing state, or start up fresh if no state;
# - DISABLED: will not read or persist any state;
# - REBIND: will rebind to the existing state, or fail if no state available;
# - CLEAN: will start up fresh (removing any existing state)
#persistMode=AUTO

# The directory to read/write persisted state (or container name if using an object store)
