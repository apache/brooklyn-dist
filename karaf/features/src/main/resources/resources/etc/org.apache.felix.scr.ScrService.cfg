# make SCR components wrapping a call eg UiMetadataConfigListener 
# use their own namespace for logging not the namespace of the wrapped class;
# to prevent flooding of the logs with low-level SCR debug for the above class.
# (not working with 2.1.24 but likely soon after as was added around time of release;
# other fields eg ds.loglevel set here are visible in karaf with scr:config)
# see https://github.com/apache/felix-dev/pull/36
