brooklyn.webconsole.security.provider = org.apache.brooklyn.rest.security.provider.AnyoneSecurityProvider

# One alternative to the above (comment out the provider above and uncomment this) 
# is to allow any localhost access and create a password for other usage
#brooklyn.webconsole.security.provider = org.apache.brooklyn.rest.security.provider.BrooklynUserWithRandomPasswordSecurityProvider

# Or to set a password and user, or multiple ones, comment the provider above out and uncomment the two lines below
#brooklyn.webconsole.security.users=admin
#brooklyn.webconsole.security.user.admin.password=password

# Refer to the documentation for other auth settings, including LDAP, and other settings
